# Crossroad simulation
 
This repository contains a proposal of a method that helps to organize car traffic on crossroad in an efficient way. Instead of using human knowledge our method will minimize time needed to pass the intersection and number of accidents
by conducting simulations where cars follow predefined rules. Rating and updating those rules allows us to find optimal solutions with the help of
Machine Learning methods, specifically the stochastic optimization(Simmulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm).
